Pong Game

Created the classic Pong game using the turtle module in python

Player 1 (left paddle) uses the "w" and "s" to move the paddle up and down

Player 2 (right paddle) uses the direction keys "Up" and "down" to move the paddle up and down

Ball increases with speed with each contact of either paddle

Ball resets after each point
